## Total Week 8 Grades
#### **24/25 for each person (5/5 for individual grades and 19/20 for group grades)**  

## Week 8 - Scrum Master Grades
Contributor | Scrum Master Grade (Out of 5) | Reasoning (Code Snippets Labelled in Project)
----------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------
Gautam Gupta | 5/5 | He worked on adding the trig functions to the [calculatorUI](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/view/CalculatorUI.java#L459) and the [MathCalc](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/control/MathCalc.java#L37) control file. He added the button mappings to the [view for calculator](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/view/CalculatorUI.java) and made sure that the functions are all working. The user selects the number they want to be put into one of the trig functions and then selects the trig function they want to use. He also made sure the GitHub was as organized as possible and made the README for the team. The README contains all of the work for our project and displays it in a way that is easy to understand and easy for the reader to find specific parts of our code and the contributors for each function. He also helped Dhruv S in making the [square root function](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/view/CalculatorUI.java#L390), the square root button and its mappings, and adding it to the [control for the MathCalc](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/control/MathCalc.java#L46). 
Dhruv Kanetkar | 5/5 | I worked on creating the MVC layout for the physics converter by adding the [solver model](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/model/SolverModel.java) and the control, which is the [physics solver](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/control/PhysicsSolv.java). It first initializes the variables for all the variables of the kinematic equations and then I made the [set functions](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/model/SolverModel.java#L12) for all the values so it can take in input from the [control](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/control/PhysicsSolv.java). I initialized the [view part](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/view/SolverUI.java) of the physics solver and made sure all the [button mappings](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/view/SolverUI.java#L97) work. I also added the initialized the physics solve to the [main menu dropdown](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/view/MainMenu.java#L86). I refactored the [buttons for calculator](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/view/CalculatorUI.java#L100) to make it more sleek.  
Tanay Shah | 5/5 | He attempted to rework the [model part](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/tree/master/src/model) of the code to abstract more but it didn't end up working so he enhanced the [converter](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/view/ConverterUI.java) and added more to it. He worked on implementing parts of the [main menu](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/view/MainMenu.java) and refined the [main menu](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/view/MainMenu.java) code. He organized the code for the entire project and made the code more modular. He also started planning out the model, view, control setup for the converter. He helped lead the aspect of the project where we envision the storyboard of the UI. 
Dhruv Sengupta | 5/5 | He looked over the previous presentation to better understand how to create better storyboards and attempted to use BlueJ. He also tried to use JFrame and SwingUI to make the visuals more appealing to the user. He then created the logic for the [derivative calculator](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/view/DerivativeCalcUI.java) and work on future enhancements in the following weeks. He used the knowledge he gained from the Tech Talks to create a visually appealing and interactive user interface and system for the user to have the best possible experience with our code and enjoy the end-product. Future goals are to make the [derivative calculator](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/src/view/DerivativeCalcUI.java) easier to use and easier to understand for people who do not understand the mathematical concepts of taking derivatives.  

## Week 8 - Overall Group Grade
Overall Group Grade (Out of 20) | Reasoning (Code Snippets Labelled in Project)
------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------
19/20 | We are on track with our schedule, improved the user experience in our code, added new functions, made the code easier to understand via comments, renamed variables, and easier view control. We also updated our README to reflect all the updates in our project (new features, new timeline, a new hierarchy, and GIF's of each sub-project running). The individual grade explanation contains lines to the actual code for explanation. 

## How to run our code?
Prerequisites: 
- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- IntelliJ

You will need to pull out code down and view it in IntelliJ. Follow this document for instructions on how to run out code: [Code Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yZMZCIHzIUx_sKJ-uUAaJKMJXkuuMoprFAGDZGbFyNE/edit?usp=sharing)


## Calculator Functions
![](https://github.com/Altoid0/CalculatorUI/blob/master/assets/HierarchyFlowchartNew.png)
We have created two main sub-projects in our CalculatorUI: 
- Scientific Calculator  
A basic scientific calculator with basic math, log, exponents, and modulus operators
- Temperature Converter  
A temperature converter that converts celsius to fahrenheit

### Scientific Calculator
Function Name | Description | How it is done
------------- | ----------- | --------------
Basic Math Operation (Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division) | Additions, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division of the numbers that the user selects | The user clicks on buttons on the GUI for the numbers and also selects an operator button on the GUI. The operator happens on the arguments and the answer is displayed on the text-field on the top.
Log | Base 10 logarithm of an argument | The user clicks on a number button followed by the log button to indicate that the user wants to take a base 10 logarithm of the number the user clicks on.
Exponents | Raise a base to the power | The user selects the base number first and then the exponent button (the upward arrow) and then selects the power the user wants to raise the base to. 
Modulus | Get the remainder when dividing two numbers | The user selects the numerator of the fraction and then the modulus operator, followed by the denominator of the fraction. The modulus function will return the remainder of the fraction. 
Trig (sin, cos, tan) | Get a trig function of an argument | The user selects a number to be inputted into one of the three trig functions (sin, cos, tan). The trig function math is all in degrees.
Square Root | Get the square root of an argument | The user selects a number to be inputted into a square root and the output is displayed on the text field.  

#### Calculator Demo

### Temperature Converter
Function Name | Description | How it is done
------------- | ----------- | --------------
Celsius to Fahrenheit | Converting the celsius degrees that the user inputs to fahrenheit | The user enters a celsius temperature in the text field on the top of the screen and then clicks convert. The fahrenheit label on the bottom then changes to display that fahrenheit temperature calculated from the equation ((Celsius x 9/5) + 32)

### Derivative Calculator
Function Name | Description | How it is done
------------- | ----------- | --------------
Derivative Calculator | Calculate a simple derivative using power rule | The user enters in the coefficient and the power to be used. The coefficient is multiplied by the power and one is subtracted from the power.

## Code in Progress
These are all of the sub-projects that we are working on currently:  
1. Physics Solver  
   We are working on the physics converter for the 4 main kinematic equations. The user will input all the values for the variables of each of the 4 kinematic equaions and the code will solve for the missing variable.
2. Derivative Calculator  
   We are working on the derivative calculator so that if the user inputs an equation, the calculator will find the derivative for it based on the 3 basic derivative rules: power rule, quotient rule, and chain rule. 

## Future Features to Add
Throughout the course of his project, we want to add more and more features to make the best calculator possible.
